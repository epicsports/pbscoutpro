# 🐛 KNOWN BUGS (from user feedback, April 2026 PXL weekend)

### ~~BUG-1: fieldSide useEffect race condition~~ ✅ FIXED (April 13, 2026)
Was: useEffect on line ~183 of MatchPage.jsx re-fired on editingId clear after
save → read stale `match.currentHomeSide` → silently reverted the swap that was
just persisted. Concurrent mode side flips also had no UI feedback.
**Fix shipped:**
- `lastSyncedHomeSideRef` now guards the sync effect: on re-fires (e.g.
  editingId clearing) where `currentHomeSide` hasn't actually changed, the
  effect is a no-op.
- Swap button + savePoint's swap branch now update local state +
  `lastSyncedHomeSideRef` **before** the async Firestore write, so the
  onSnapshot round-trip is also a no-op.
- Toast `⇄ Sides swapped — other coach flipped orientation` fires when the
  sync applies an external change.
- Base indicator pills (`◀ BASE {teamName}` / `{teamName} BASE ▶`) overlay
  the canvas corners, color-coded per team, so scouts can orient instantly.

---

# 🔨 NEEDS VALIDATION
- Ballistics accuracy: engine rewritten but needs tuning against real field data
- OCR/Vision scan: works but requires user's Anthropic API key in localStorage
- Concurrent scouting: needs real 2-device test with Tymek

---

# 📋 PLANNED (needs Opus brief before CC implements)

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: 🚨 Relax PBLeagues onboarding — second signup blocker resolved (P0 URGENT)
Deployed in merge of `feat/relax-pbleagues-onboarding-2026-04-24` (commit `2f8f971`, 1 commit). After `c9d99eb` retired the team-code gate and auto-joined users to ranger1996, users STILL hit the legacy strict-NNNNN-NNNN regex + dead-end "Nie znaleziono gracza" branch on `PbleaguesOnboardingPage`. Rewrote the page to render `<LinkProfileModal>` (reused verbatim from `fa2f15c`) inside the existing shell — same 5-priority cascade, same "Czy to ty?" confirm, same "Pomiń na razie" skip fallback. Zero logic duplication. Skip writes `users/{uid}.linkSkippedAt`; `App.jsx` gate updated (`if (!linkedPlayer && !userProfile?.linkSkippedAt)`). Link uses `selfLinkPlayer` for symmetry with ProfilePage. `onPlayerLinked` migration fires afterwards. No rules change. Legacy `parsePbliId` + `linkPbliPlayer` kept in place but no longer called from UI.

**Known follow-ups:**
- `pbliIdFull` not written via the new link path. If a user types `61114-8236`, the full form isn't preserved. Admin can fill via Členkowie. If this becomes a real need, either teach `selfLinkPlayer` to accept an optional pbliIdFull or detect valid full form client-side and opt into `linkPbliPlayer`.
- Legacy `parsePbliId` / `linkPbliPlayer` / `PBLI_ID_FULL_REGEX` left in `roleUtils.js` + `dataService.js` since the UI no longer imports them. Safe to remove in a follow-up cleanup if they stay unused for a sprint.
- `linkSkippedAt` is a boolean-like flag (only its existence matters). Admin can null it via Firestore console to force-re-onboard a user if needed. Not exposed in Členkowie UI — add if it becomes a real workflow.

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: 🚨 Retire team-code + auto-join ranger1996 + members panel audit (P0 URGENT)
Deployed in merge of `feat/retire-team-code-auto-join-2026-04-24` (commit `c9d99eb`, 1 commit). 100% of new users were blocked — signup → legacy "Team code" screen → typed `Ranger1996` → "Permission denied". `LoginGate` DELETED. WorkspaceProvider now auto-enters the default workspace (`userProfile.defaultWorkspace` or `DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_SLUG` fallback) as soon as `user` + `userProfile` resolve. New `<AutoEnterErrorScreen>` surfaces failures with sign-out escape. Password-gated `enterWorkspace(code)` path preserved for admin workspace-switch. Members panel Variant 3 surface: `useUserProfiles` returns `createdAt`, active members sorted desc, green "Nowy" badge on ≤7d joiners (non-interactive → green not amber, § 27 compliant), section header sub-count "N nowych w tym tygodniu". Rules: no change — writes stay in the existing self-join envelope.

**Known follow-ups:**
- Legacy users with no `createdAt` sort to the bottom. Low priority; could add a "no timestamp" pill if it confuses admin.
- `DEFAULT_USER_ROLES = ['player']` — admin still manually assigns scout/coach/admin via Members panel for specific users.
- Legacy user with no sessionStorage AND pre-§49 user doc (missing `defaultWorkspace`) falls back to DEFAULT_WORKSPACE_SLUG unconditionally per Variant 3. If Jacek wants workspace-picker UX for multi-workspace future, it's a separate brief.

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: Step 5 sticky + Coach live-score + PPT unlinked-mode (3 fixes batched)
Deployed in merge of `feat/coach-parity-step5-sticky-ppt-unlinked-2026-04-24` (commit `fa2f15c`, 3 commits + Firestore rules redeploy). (1) **Step 5 sticky CTA** — pinned "Zapisz punkt" to viewport bottom (mirrors Step 3 fix from `34755ce`). (2) **Coach live-score parity** — extracted `useLiveMatchScores` to `src/hooks/useLiveMatchScores.js`, wired CoachTabContent (closes the symmetry gap from P0 Fix 1 commit `629edc8`). (3) **PPT unlinked-mode** (option (a) from relax-player-linking Checkpoint 1 audit) — new `pendingSelfReports` collection + Firestore rule + service dual-path + offline-queue mode-namespacing + `onPlayerLinked` migrate-on-link helper wired into both ProfilePage and PbleaguesOnboardingPage link paths. UI: hard guard on `playerId` removed; `WizardShell` + `TodaysLogsList` accept `uid` and branch storage; new translucent-amber unlinked banner on both surfaces routes to `/profile`. `usePPTIdentity` returns `uid` and shows ALL workspace trainings to unlinked users.

**Known follow-ups:**
- `pendingSelfReports` not included in `getLayoutShotFrequencies` collection-group query — crowdsource picker doesn't see unlinked shots until migration. Trade-off documented in DEPLOY_LOG.
- Unlinked users see ALL workspace trainings (no team filter). Adequate for v1; "for me / any" toggle is a cheap follow-up if it becomes noisy.
- Migration is per-link with no auto-retry. Cloud Function trigger on `players/{pid}.linkedUid` change would be production-grade; deferred.
- ScoutTabContent + CoachTabContent now share `useLiveMatchScores` — any future change to listener semantics lands in one place.

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: 🚨 Relax player linking — PBLI cascade + confirm + skip (P0 URGENT)
Deployed in merge of `feat/relax-player-linking-2026-04-24` (commit `83c929b`, 1 commit). Real users blocked from self-linking via ProfilePage due to PBLI ID format mismatches (legacy matcher didn't strip `#`, short-circuited pbliIdFull lookups). Replaced substring matcher with 4-priority cascade in new `src/utils/pbliMatching.js`: exact pbliId / exact pbliIdFull / first-segment / substring. LinkProfileModal rewritten as 3-state in-place swap (list / confirm / no-match) with ALWAYS-required "Czy to ty?" confirmation before write + "Pomiń na razie" skip-link CTA. Defensive write-side normalize in PlayerEditModal + CSVImport. PPT empty-state gains prominent "Połącz teraz" CTA routing to ProfilePage. Shared modal means Členkowie admin panel picks up same behavior (with confirm gate). **Option B chosen** per Checkpoint 1 audit — PPT unlinked mode DEFERRED (data-model + rules scope); shipping matching/confirm/skip-link first matches Saturday priority.

**Known follow-ups:**
- PPT unlinked mode (~2-3h): new `/users/{uid}/selfReports/{sid}` rule + dual-write service path + dual-read hook merge + migration-on-link. Follow-up brief if users complain about "can't log pre-link".
- Admin bulk-linking in Členkowie now has one extra confirm tap. Add `quickMode` prop to LinkProfileModal if that workflow becomes real.
- Priority 5 name-similarity (Levenshtein) skipped — existing nickname/name substring covers the realistic case.

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: 🚨 React #310 crash in tournament scouting (P0 BLOCKER)
Deployed in merge of `hotfix/scouting-react-310-crash-2026-04-24` (commit `bbad249`, 1 commit). Tournament Scout view crashed with React #310 immediately on open — entire scouting flow unreachable, blocking Saturday usage. Root cause: P0 Fix 1 (commit `629edc8`) added `useMemo(liveCandidateIds)` + `useLiveMatchScores(...)` hooks at lines 223 / 227 of `ScoutTabContent.jsx`, BELOW the existing `if (!tournament) return` early return at line 141. On first render the guard fired (17 hooks ran); next render past the guard ran 19 → hook-count mismatch. Fix: hoist the two live-score hooks above the guard. Functional behavior preserved — no revert needed; P0 Fix 1's live-score feature still works end-to-end. Other scouting files audited (CoachTabContent, CompletenessCard) — no similar violations.

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: PPT hotfix follow-up — Step 1 dedup + Step 3 sticky CTA
Deployed direct to main (commit `34755ce`). Two follow-ups from same-day iPhone validation of the prior PPT hotfix batch. (A) **Step 1 dedup** — mirrored the Step 3 fix into `Step1Breakout.jsx` (bootstrap path was hitting the same twin-cell bug as Step 3 did). (B) **Step 3 "Dalej →" pinned** — § 48.3 spec called for sticky footer but implementation rendered the CTA inline; pinned to viewport bottom with `position: fixed` + safe-area inset + gradient fade. 120px spacer reserves room under the footer so the last grid row remains scrollable into view.

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: PPT hotfix batch — sticky training + shots picker dedup
Deployed in merge of `hotfix/ppt-training-sticky-shots-dedup-2026-04-24` (commit `31c1f7d`, 2 commits). Two PPT regressions surfaced by Jacek's iPhone validation pre-Saturday training. (1) **Fix 1 sticky training selection** — pre-fix the picker re-appeared on every "+ Nowy punkt" tap when liveTrainings.length !== 1. New `src/utils/pptActiveTraining.js` (date-stamped localStorage), entry logic prioritizes sticky over showList/single-LIVE inference, `handleSave` resets state in-place + bumps local pill count + inline toast (no navigation), training pill becomes the "Zmień trening" affordance (clears sticky + forces picker), Step 1 back arrow uses `?leave=1` to break the sticky-redirect loop. (2) **Fix 2 shots picker dedup** — `bunkerListFromLayout` only filtered `role==='mirror'` but `layout.bunkers` can carry duplicate entries per `positionName` (legacy docs without `role`, or BunkerEditorPage's master+mirror persistence with shared name). `BunkerPickerGrid` keys order-badges by `positionName` → twin-badge symptom. Defensive first-write-wins dedupe in Step 3's local helper. **Spec deviations:** "Zmień trening" implemented as extension of existing pill rather than separate link (§ 27 anti-pattern avoidance); save flow uses in-place state reset rather than navigate-to-wizard-URL (avoids flash + round-trip).

**Known follow-ups:**
- ~~Step 1 bootstrap dedup~~ — DONE in `34755ce` follow-up.
- TodaysLogsList view now only reachable via Step 1 back arrow + `?leave=1`. Pill counter shows `#N pkt dziś` inline so visibility preserved.
- `useMemo` reads localStorage on every teamTrainings change. Cheap; no observable cost.
- Step 5 "Zapisz punkt" CTA is also inline (not sticky). § 48.3 spec calls for sticky there too. Cheap symmetry fix if Jacek hits the same scroll-off issue on Step 5.

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: ProfilePage hotfix batch — 3 regressions
Deployed in merge of `hotfix/profile-page-regressions-2026-04-24` (commit `04ff7fc`, 3 commits). Three regressions on Mój profil surfaced by iPhone validation, batched into a single deploy. (1) **Fix 1 linked-player self-claim restored (§ 49.8 Path A)** — § 33.3 ProfilePage shipped without unlinked-state UI. Added empty-state + "Połącz z profilem gracza" CTA reusing admin `LinkProfileModal`; linked state unchanged except new "Rozłącz" row on separate surface (§ 27 anti-pattern avoidance, § 50.3 Wyjdź precedent). New `ds.selfLinkPlayer` (transactional, surfaces ALREADY_LINKED) + `ds.selfUnlinkPlayer` — no rules change needed (self-link + self-unlink carve-outs from § 33.3 + § 50.3 already whitelist exactly these writes). (2) **Fix 2 missing i18n keys** — `t('key') || 'fallback'` short-circuits to raw key. Added full `profile_roles_*` + `profile_player_*` + `profile_claim_*` + `profile_unlink_*` sets in PL+EN. (3) **Fix 3 remove "Podgląd: Admin" floating pill** — removed `<ViewAsIndicator />` from App.jsx, neutralised `ViewAsContext` (always null + clears stale sessionStorage on mount), replaced `ViewAsPill` in ADMIN settings with new `ViewAsPlaceholder` (toast "Funkcja wkrótce"). Old ViewAs* files kept on disk for easy revival. **Spec deviation:** § 50.1 kept ViewAsPill functional in ADMIN; hotfix brief updated direction toward placeholder.

**Known follow-ups:**
- § 50.1 DESIGN_DECISIONS entry is now stale — either codify the placeholder-only state or revive the feature.
- ViewAs feature dormant, not deleted. Admin loses role-impersonation preview surface until revived.
- `navigate` import in ProfilePage.jsx is unused (pre-existing, untouched).

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: P0 micro-hotfixes batch
Deployed in merge of `hotfix/p0-batch-2026-04-23` (commit `629edc8`, 3 commits). Three independent fixes batched into one deploy: (1) **Scout card score** — useLiveMatchScores hook subscribes to subscribePoints per non-closed match, derives {a,b} via canonical matchScore helper extracted to utils/helpers.js, MatchCard accepts liveScore prop. Side-effect fix: LIVE/Scheduled classification bug (same Brief 9 Bug 2 root cause). (2) **Side percentages removed from heatmap** for all roles — CoachingStats block deleted from MatchPage; computeCoachingStats function preserved for ScoutedTeamPage. (3) **releaseClaim ReferenceError** — two orphan call sites in MatchPage back handlers (Brief F leftover). `grep releaseClaim` now returns zero.

**Known follow-ups:**
- CoachTabContent has the same Scout-card score bug — out of brief scope, cheap symmetry fix if needed
- Brief 9 Bug 2 write-side decision left intact (race avoidance preserved)

### [DONE] 2026-04-24: Settings menu reorg + nav cleanup + Członkowie full UX (§ 50)
Deployed in merge of `feat/settings-reorg-nav-cleanup` (commit `0fe8739`, 4 commits across 3 checkpoints). Six-section Settings menu (SESJA / ZARZĄDZAJ / SCOUTING / WORKSPACE / KONTO / ADMIN) per Jacek spec with strict role gating per § 49. Tab "More" → "Ustawienia". Legacy `BottomNav.jsx` deleted; AppShell role-tab bar is now the only bottom nav (Scout/Coach/Gracz/Ustawienia). Wyjdź workspace flow added (`ds.leaveWorkspaceSelf` + ConfirmModal + last-admin guard) — Firestore rules carve-outs for self-leave on workspace + self-unlink on player. **Członkowie full UX**: new `/settings/members/:uid` UserDetailPage with admin link override (LinkProfileModal — search players, conflict surface, atomic re-link via `ds.adminLinkPlayer`), unlink, deliberate role edit, soft-delete via `users/{uid}.disabled` flag (rule via ADMIN_EMAILS allowlist). AppRoutes bootstrap watches the disabled flag and renders DisabledAccountScreen. Four spec deviations documented in DEPLOY_LOG.

**Known follow-ups (§ 50.7):**
- Per-workspace admin check on `/users/{uid}` writes (replace ADMIN_EMAILS allowlist, requires custom claims)
- Server-side Firebase Auth deletion (true delete, requires Admin SDK + Cloud Function)
- Coach/staff profile entities (only player profiles exist today)
- Toast for legacy URL clicks (currently no redirect — pages remain reachable from Settings)
- DRY between MoreTabContent + TrainingMoreTab helpers (Training* prefix duplication)

### [DONE] 2026-04-23: ProfilePage roles + linked-player self-edit (§ 33.3)
Deployed in merge of `feat/profile-player-section` (commit `0da83b4`, deploy log `7e69a2f`). ProfilePage now renders read-only Roles section (`RoleChips` from canonical `useWorkspace().roles` resolver) and a 6-field self-edit form for the linked player (nickname/name/number/age/nationality/favoriteBunker) when the active workspace contains a player doc with `linkedUid === auth.uid`. Team / PBLI ID / role / class stay admin-only via Firestore rules `affectedKeys.hasOnly([...])` whitelist on `/players/{pid}` update. User-doc photoURL editor *removed* — multi-player reality means a single avatar URL doesn't fit (Jacek interrupt). Firestore rules deployed via `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules` before client merge.

### [DONE] 2026-04-23: Unified auth + roles + tab visibility (§ 49)
Deployed in merge of `feat/auth-roles-unified`. New users auto-assigned to ranger1996 workspace + `['player']` role on signup. Strict per-role tab visibility matrix (admin/coach/scout/player/viewer-legacy). New Gracz tab routes to `/player/log`. PPT Firestore rules hotfix deployed alongside (selfReports subcollection + collection-group read). Admin panel already handles the new model (Path A verified). **Brief E Option 2 (PPT reachability) wchłonięte — DONE.** Migration policy: new users only; existing users untouched until admin reassigns.

### [DONE] 2026-04-23: Player Performance Tracker (PPT) — full product
Deployed in merge of `feat/player-performance-tracker` (7 commits, Tier 2 / 5 checkpoints). Route `/player/log` picker + `/player/log/wizard` 5-step wizard + today's logs list + offline queue. Firestore indexes deployed via `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`. Spec lives in `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md § 48` + `docs/product/PPT_MOCKUP.md`. Brief pasted inline (no archive file). iPhone validation pending.

**Known follow-ups:**
- Role gating (Brief E Option 2) — required for pure-player reachability
- Matchup-matching product — coach-side assignment of orphan `selfReports`
- Post-save list row edit/delete (§ 48.10 deferred)

### From user feedback (F1-F7):
1. **~~F1+F2: Side confusion fix~~** → ✅ **FIXED** — BUG-1 patched by CC (lastSyncedHomeSideRef, swap toast, base indicator pills)
2. **F3: Quick shots dual mode** → **ACTIVE: `CC_BRIEF_QUICK_SHOTS.md`** (zone toggles + precise drill-down)
3. **F4: Sample size indicator** → **ACTIVE: `CC_BRIEF_TEAM_STATS_CARDS.md`** (n=X on tournament team cards)
4. **Match flow redesign** → **ACTIVE: `CC_BRIEF_MATCH_FLOW.md`** (three-level nav, eliminate side picker, split-tap match cards, match review page, point summary bar)
5. **F5: Self-scouting** — scout own team + counter analysis view
6. **F6: Tournament profiles** — may be solved by quick shots (quick vs deep modes)
7. **F7: Training data → break selection** — practice data informing break choices

### Features:
- BreakAnalyzer module (spec: BREAK_ANALYZER_SPEC.md, BREAK_ANALYZER_DOMAIN_v2.md)
- Tournament tendencies (team/lineup/player level analytics)
- Practice tournament type (ad-hoc lineups, no player history impact)
- Security Phase 3: server-side admin verification

# 🧹 Post-Saturday cleanup (after NXL Czechy 2026-04-25)

Tech-debt + investigation items surfaced during Brief 6-9 pre-Saturday sprint. None are Saturday-blocking; schedule after match validation.

### Brief 10 — enroll/membership cleanup (tech debt)
- Workspace ID case normalization (`users/{uid}/workspaces[0]` vs actual doc casing)
- Role field: migrate from comma-separated string `"scout,coach,admin"` to array
- Sync `users.workspaces` array ↔ `workspaces/{slug}.members` array (currently can drift)
- Audit `pendingApprovals` cleanup
- Problem manifested in 2-device test: biuro user had workspace "Ranger1996" but doc is `workspaces/ranger1996` (lowercase). Required manual Firestore edit to grant membership.

### Diagnostic logs removal (BUG-B / BUG-C)
- After Saturday validation confirms concurrent scouting works end-to-end
- Remove `[BUG-B]` and `[BUG-C]` console.log statements from MatchPage.jsx
- Keep in prod during Saturday match itself (useful if something breaks on real devices)
- Target: Sunday 2026-04-26 cleanup PR

### Claim fields retirement
- `match.homeClaimedBy`, `awayClaimedBy`, `homeClaimedAt`, `awayClaimedAt` fields
- Still written on side selection but no longer used for routing under Brief 8 (per-coach streams have own identity via coachUid)
- Safe to retire: stop writing + lazy cleanup
- Low priority — harmless if left

### Investigation: `match.currentHomeSide` necessity under Brief 8
- See DESIGN_DECISIONS § 44.5
- Question: should flip pill update only local state with no Firestore write?
- Currently shared between coaches via match doc, which introduces surprising semantics
- Not a bug, but architectural cleanup candidate
