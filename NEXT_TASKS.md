# NEXT TASKS — For Claude Code
## Read docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md + docs/PROJECT_GUIDELINES.md first.
## Work top to bottom. Push after each task.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-12 by Opus + CC docs patch (rebase onto Brief A shipped state)
**Rules:** Inline JSX styles (COLORS/FONT/TOUCH from theme.js). English UI labels.
Don't touch `src/workers/ballisticsEngine.js` (Opus territory).
Git: `user.name="Claude Code"`, `user.email="code@pbscoutpro.dev"`

# 🟢 ACTIVE — Pre-NXL Czechy 2026-05-15

One brief queued for CC. **Must merge before NXL.**
Brief A (Pre-NXL Refinements) is **already shipped** on main — see `DEPLOY_LOG.md` entry 2026-05-12 (merge `36104cb`, deploy `3a1ffed`, § 60 in DESIGN_DECISIONS).

## Brief B — Deaths Heatmap v2
- **Path:** `CC_BRIEF_DEATHS_HEATMAP_V2_2026-05-12.md` (repo root)
- **Branch:** `feat/deaths-heatmap-v2`
- **Scope:** LayoutAnalyticsPage `mode='deaths'` refactor. Isolated to that one screen.
  - New attribution helper `src/utils/deathAttribution.js` (precision + zone + 1/N split, fractional credits)
  - Scope filter pills: Layout / Tournament / Match / Point (progressive disclosure, no global)
  - "Pozycja strzelca" column in deaths table (format `Snake1 · D2`)
  - Shooter markers on heatmap with fractional kill-credit badges
  - Linked highlighting cross-filter: skull ↔ attributing shooters, 30% opacity fade for unrelated
  - Density layer auto-hide when filteredPoints.length < 5
- **Effort:** ~2 CC sprints (7 stages with Jacek checkpoints).
- **Risk:** moderate. New isolated module — § 30 formula and all global kill displays untouched.
- **Deploy:** after Brief A is on main and verified.

# 🔴 POST-NXL — Queued

Items deferred until after NXL Czechy 2026-05-15. Higher-risk or
dependent on architectural decisions (sparing rozkmina).

## User feedback from Jacek 2026-05-12 — moderate/risky tier

- **SCOUT #1:** Roster picker should filter per-tournament roster (currently shows parent + all child teams). Need CC discovery on data flow before fix.
- **SCOUT #2:** Self-log FAB icon visible when it shouldn't be. Need CC discovery — pin down where gating fails. Distinct from earlier Issue #4 (PPT picker training-only).
- **SCOUT #3:** Cache leak between scouted points — viewing point N then scouting new point loads N's data into draft. Likely `useEffect` cleanup bug in MatchPage. Critical for scouting integrity.
- **SCOUT #4:** Partial save — save break without point outcome. Schema change (`point.status='partial'`). Coordinate with sparing architecture rozkmina.
- **SCOUT #5:** Concurrent scouting side flip for "lazy scout" rotating 4 teams (AvB then CvD on alternate points, scout stays one side). Overlaps with existing `outputs/CC_BRIEF_AUTO_SWAP_REGRESSION.md` — verify status with CC first; may already be addressed.
- **SCOUT #7:** Completeness table moved to bottom of scouting view above END MATCH, collapsed by default.
- **COACH #5:** Strzelanie percentage formula refactor (denominator = N×5 − runners − undeclared = 100%). Independent ticket from COACH #4 (banner shipped in Brief A).
- **NEW ACCOUNT #1:** Onboarding hang — new user gets stuck on player profile match modal. App should work without matched profile. **Critical UX for new user funnel.**

## Pre-existing roadmap (from prior planning sessions)

- **Auto-swap regression** — `outputs/CC_BRIEF_AUTO_SWAP_REGRESSION.md`. **Verify status with CC** — may have shipped post-2026-04-28; if not, brief still valid. Gates SCOUT #5.
- **Security-roles-v2 finish** — branch `feat/security-roles-v2`. Commits 1+2 done (foundation + PBleagues onboarding + Settings UI). Pending: Commit 3 (View Switcher), Commit 4 (Firestore rules + cleanup), smoke tests, merge.
- **Sparing architecture rozkmina** (Issues #3 + #6 from prior session) — 5 product decisions needed: collection affiliation, sticky-state localStorage keying, wizard host resolution, copy/UI context assumptions, events unification. Gates PPT picker fix, sparing implementation, and player claim flow brief.
- **Events architecture decision** — unifying training/tournament/sparing: Model A (status quo, separate collections), Model B (single `events` collection), or Model C (lightweight `events_index`). Sub-decision within sparing rozkmina.
- **Player motivation claim flow brief** — mockup approved 2026-05-02 at `outputs/player_claim_flow_mockup.html`. Brief TBD post-sparing.
- **Self-log Phase 1b** — propagator / matcher / conflict resolver. Deferred post-sparing.
- **`ARCHITECTURE_C4_v2.html` + § 38 in DESIGN_DECISIONS** — needs CC discovery pass against real production code before diagramming. Blocked on desktop session with GitHub connector.
- **Tier D security items** — custom claims, per-pid selfReports ownership, `/users` global read, adminUid create-time validation. Post-MAX explicit defer.

## Features (longer-horizon backlog)

- **BreakAnalyzer module** — Phase 1 spec at `docs/architecture/BREAK_ANALYZER_SPEC.md`. Implementation scaffolded but needs tuning vs real field data. Opus territory.
- **Tournament tendencies** — team / lineup / player level analytics. Blocks on sufficient scouted data volume + SelfLog maturity.
- **F5: Self-scouting + counter analysis** — partially addressed by SelfLog hybrid view; may need own brief.
- **F6: Tournament profiles** — per Jacek may be solved by quick shots dual mode (verify).
- **F7: Training data → break selection** — adjacent to SelfLog flywheel; wait for data to accumulate first.
- **Practice tournament type** — ad-hoc lineups, no player history impact.
